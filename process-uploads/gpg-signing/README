The openwrt package repositories contain a Packages.asc file. This file appears
to be unused by opkg client so MassMesh does not currently provide a Packages.asc
file.

When we want to start providing it, here's how the server should be configured to
generate this file automatically whenever our package repositories are updated.

1. Follow the instructions at
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/security/keygen to generate a GPG keypair
and a signing subkey.

2. Install the subkey (only!) on the host that is going to sign the Packages
file. This is described at https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/security/keygen

3. Create ~uploader/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:

# 1 year
default-cache-ttl 31536000
max-cache-ttl 31536000
enable-ssh-support

4. After every boot (or whenever gpg-agent is stopped), run the 'startup-agent.sh'
script.

5. Apply the `process-uploads-gpg-signing.patch` patch from this directory to
process-uploads.sh.
